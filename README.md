# Critiqr

Critiqr is a web application made to help job seekers improve their resume through peer-review. Anyone looking for resume critique can simply create a post, and other people can provide their insights on how to make the resume better through a comment below the post. 

Critiqr was created using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack. It also uses AWS S3 to store resume files.
